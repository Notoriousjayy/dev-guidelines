# C Best Practices

## Security Principles
- **Input Validation:**
  - Use secure functions like `fgets()` instead of `gets()` to prevent buffer overflows.
  - Validate input length and format before processing.
  - Avoid trusting input from unverified sources.

- **Secure String Handling:**
  - Use `strncpy()` instead of `strcpy()` to avoid buffer overflows.
  - Always null-terminate strings explicitly if needed.

- **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets:**
  - Use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., environment variables) instead of embedding secrets directly in code.

---

## Memory Safety
- **Memory Allocation:**
  - Prefer `calloc()` over `malloc()` to zero-initialize memory and reduce vulnerabilities due to uninitialized memory access.
  - Free dynamically allocated memory with `free()` and ensure double-free vulnerabilities are avoided.

- **Buffer Safety:**
  - Avoid off-by-one errors by ensuring buffer bounds checks.
  - Use functions like `memcpy_s()` and `strncpy()` for safer memory copying.

- **Pointer Safety:**
  - Always initialize pointers to `NULL` and check before dereferencing.
  - Avoid pointer arithmetic unless absolutely necessary, and validate the resulting pointer.

---

## Error Handling
- **Use Return Codes:**
  - Check the return values of all standard library functions.
  - For critical functions, log and handle errors explicitly.

- **`errno` Management:**
  - Reset `errno` before operations that may fail and check its value afterwards.
  - Avoid overwriting `errno` unintentionally.

---

## Compiler Settings
- **Recommended Compiler Flags:**
  - `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` for GCC/Clang to catch common coding errors.
  - `-fsanitize=address` to detect memory corruption issues.

- **Standards Conformance:**
  - Use `-std=c99` or later to ensure modern C practices and compatibility.

---

## File I/O
- **Avoid Vulnerable Functions:**
  - Replace `sprintf()` with `snprintf()` to prevent buffer overflows.
  - Always validate file handles before performing read/write operations.

- **Safe File Access:**
  - Use `fopen_s()` instead of `fopen()` on platforms where it's available.
  - Avoid hardcoding file paths; use configurable parameters instead.

---

## Integer Safety
- **Prevent Overflow:**
  - Use `size_t` for array indices and avoid signed integer overflow.
  - Validate ranges before performing arithmetic operations.

- **Avoid Truncation:**
  - Use explicit casting to prevent truncation during type conversion.
Here is a more thorough and comprehensive version of the `best-practices.md` file, based on MISRA C:2023 guidelines. This version includes details across all relevant areas with examples and justifications.

# Best Practices for C Programming in Critical Systems

## Overview
This document outlines best practices derived from MISRA C:2023 for developing safe, secure, and portable C programs in critical systems. These guidelines ensure compliance with safety, security, and reliability requirements.

---

## General Principles

### Adherence to Standards
- Use a defined subset of the C language to reduce ambiguity and potential programming errors.
- Eliminate or mitigate undefined and implementation-specific behaviors.
- Follow mandatory, required, and advisory guidelines as outlined by MISRA C.

### Documentation and Traceability
- All implementation-defined behaviors that affect program output **must** be documented and thoroughly understood.
- Ensure every piece of code is traceable to specific, documented requirements to eliminate unnecessary or unintentional functionality.

---

## Code Design and Development

### Robustness Against Failures
- Perform **dynamic checks** to minimize run-time errors:
  - Ensure array indices are within bounds before accessing.
  - Validate all pointers before dereferencing.
  - Guard against arithmetic errors such as overflow, underflow, or divide-by-zero.
- Provide clear documentation for areas where dynamic checks are omitted, supported by static analysis or design assumptions.

### Encapsulation
- Encapsulate assembly language within macros or inline functions for portability and maintainability.
- Use opaque data types to hide implementation details and reduce unintentional modifications.

### Use of Typedefs
- Replace basic types (`int`, `float`, etc.) with specific-length typedefs (`int32_t`, `uint8_t`) to ensure predictable memory use.
- Avoid defining types that do not match their intended size or signedness.

---

## Use of Libraries and Functions

### Validation of Inputs
- Validate all inputs passed to library functions, including those in the Standard Library and custom libraries.
- Examples:
  - Check that arguments to `sqrt` are non-negative.
  - Ensure the second argument of `fmod` is non-zero.

### Error Handling
- Test all error information returned by functions immediately after execution.
- If error testing is not required due to pre-validation, document this explicitly.

### Avoid Function-Like Macros
- Prefer inline functions over function-like macros to ensure argument type-checking and prevent multiple evaluations of macro arguments.

---

## Memory Management

### Avoid Dynamic Allocation
- Avoid using dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) in critical systems to prevent undefined behaviors such as memory leaks or invalid access.

---

## File and Header Management

### Prevent Multiple Inclusions
- Use include guards to prevent the same header file from being included multiple times:
  ```c
  #ifndef HEADER_NAME
  #define HEADER_NAME
  // Header content
  #endif
  ```

### Consistent Naming
- Use meaningful, typographically unambiguous names for identifiers:
  - Avoid `O` vs. `0`, `l` vs. `1`, `I` vs. `l`.
  - Prefer descriptive names with underscores or camelCase for clarity.

---

## Concurrency and Synchronization

### Concurrency Awareness
- Design for thread safety when using C11/C18 threading features.
- Avoid race conditions by using synchronization primitives such as mutexes or atomics.

### Minimize Shared Resources
- Encapsulate shared resources and use controlled access patterns to ensure consistency.

---

## Static Analysis and Tools

### Leverage Analysis Tools
- Use static analysis tools capable of checking MISRA C compliance. Ensure these tools are correctly configured for the project.
- Address all reported violations, especially for mandatory and required rules.

### Scope of Analysis
- Analyze both system-level and translation-unit-level code for full coverage of rules and guidelines.

---

## Example Implementations

### Avoiding Undefined Behavior
**Non-compliant Example:**
```c
int x = 0;
if (x = 1) { // Mistake: assignment instead of comparison
    // Code
}
```

**Compliant Example:**
```c
int x = 0;
if (x == 1) { // Correct: comparison operator
    // Code
}
```

### Validating Inputs
**Non-compliant Example:**
```c
double result = sqrt(-1); // Invalid input for sqrt
```

**Compliant Example:**
```c
if (value >= 0) {
    double result = sqrt(value);
} else {
    // Handle error
}
```

---

## Exceptions and Deviations

### Formal Documentation of Deviations
- If deviations from mandatory or required guidelines are necessary, document them formally as per MISRA Compliance processes.
- Justify deviations with clear reasoning, impact analysis, and any mitigating strategies.

---

## Advanced Topics

### Automatically Generated Code
- Ensure code generated by tools adheres to MISRA C where applicable.
- Validate the configuration and behavior of code-generation tools to ensure compliance.

### Multi-Organization Collaboration
- For shared projects, define a unified compliance strategy and agree on coding standards upfront.
- When sharing precompiled libraries, provide documentation or compliance declarations.

   - Use single-line comments (`//`) for brief notes.
   - Do not comment out code; use `#if 0` blocks for disabling code temporarily.

2. **Location and Content:**
   - Place comments above the code they describe. Use **TODO**, **NOTE**, or **WARNING** markers to emphasize specific areas.

3. **Assumptions and References:**
   - Document any assumptions or references to external documents, such as specifications or patents.

---

## **Naming Conventions**

1. **Variables:**
   - Use descriptive names:
     - Globals: `g_variable_name`
     - Pointers: `p_variable_name`
     - Booleans: `b_is_condition_met`
   - Avoid short or cryptic names (minimum 3 characters).

2. **Functions:**
   - Use action verbs or questions in names, e.g., `read_sensor()` or `is_device_active()`.

3. **Modules and Files:**
   - Use lowercase names with underscores (e.g., `device_driver.c`).
   - Include "main" in any file with the `main()` function.

4. **Reserved Names:**
   - Avoid names from standard libraries (e.g., `errno`, `strlen`) or reserved keywords.

---

## **Code Organization**

1. **File Structure:**
   - Separate headers (`.h`) and source files (`.c`).
   - Include:
     - Header guards (`#ifndef HEADER_NAME`) for headers.
     - Section markers for constants, variables, functions, etc.

2. **File Templates:**
   - Use predefined templates for all files to ensure consistency.

3. **Block Layout:**
   - Separate logical blocks with blank lines.
   - Place related declarations and definitions together.

---

## **Data Type Rules**

   - Use `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, etc., for precision. Avoid `short` and `long`.

2. **Booleans:**
   - Declare all Boolean variables as `bool` from `stdbool.h`.

3. **Floating Point:**
   - Minimize floating-point usage. Use fixed-point arithmetic where possible.

4. **Structures and Unions:**
   - Use `typedef` for all structs and unions.
   - Prevent padding issues by validating layout sizes with preprocessor checks.

---

## Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for C programming in critical systems, focusing on safety, security, and reliability. It incorporates best practices, code examples, and justifications for each recommendation to help developers produce high-quality code that meets stringent industry standards.

---

## General Principles

### Adherence to Standards

- **Use a Defined Subset of C:**
  - Employ a well-defined subset of the C language to reduce ambiguity and potential errors.
  - Avoid language features that lead to undefined or implementation-specific behavior.

- **Follow Language Standards:**
  - Stick to standard C99 or later to utilize modern features and ensure compatibility.
  - Avoid using compiler-specific extensions unless absolutely necessary and well-documented.

### Documentation and Traceability

- **Document Implementation-Defined Behavior:**
  - Record any implementation-specific behavior that affects program output.
  - Ensure all team members understand these behaviors and their implications.

- **Requirement Traceability:**
  - Maintain traceability between code and its corresponding requirements.
  - Avoid unnecessary code that does not fulfill documented requirements.

---

## Code Design and Development

### Robustness Against Failures

- **Perform Run-Time Checks:**
  - **Array Bounds Checking:**
    - Ensure array indices are within valid bounds before accessing.
  - **Pointer Validation:**
    - Check pointers for `NULL` before dereferencing.
  - **Arithmetic Error Prevention:**
    - Guard against divide-by-zero, overflows, and underflows.

- **Document Assumptions:**
  - If certain checks are omitted based on design assumptions, document them thoroughly.
  - Use static analysis tools to verify that these assumptions hold.

### Avoid Undefined and Unspecified Behavior

- **Eliminate Undefined Behavior:**
  - Avoid code constructs that lead to undefined behavior, such as dereferencing invalid pointers or accessing uninitialized variables.

- **Avoid Critical Unspecified Behavior:**
  - Do not rely on behaviors that the C standard leaves unspecified and could vary between compilers.

### Encapsulation

- **Isolate Assembly Code:**
  - Encapsulate assembly instructions within functions or macros.

- **Use Opaque Data Types:**
  - Hide implementation details by using pointers to incomplete types.

### Use of Typedefs

- **Specific-Length Integer Types:**
  - Use fixed-width integer types like `int32_t`, `uint16_t` for predictable behavior.

- **Avoid Basic Numerical Types:**
  - Do not use plain `int`, `short`, `long` as their sizes can vary between platforms.

---

## Data Types and Declarations

### Bit-Fields Usage

- **Appropriate Types for Bit-Fields:**
  - Use `unsigned int` or `signed int` for declaring bit-fields.
  - Avoid using types like `char`, `short`, or enumerated types for bit-fields.

- **Single-Bit Signed Bit-Fields:**
  - Do not declare single-bit signed bit-fields, as they may not behave as expected.

- **Bit-Fields in Unions:**
  - Do not declare bit-fields as members of unions to prevent implementation-defined behavior.

### Constants and Literals

- **Avoid Octal Constants:**
  - Do not use octal constants, as they can be confusing and error-prone.

- **Unsigned Integer Constants:**
  - Apply a `u` or `U` suffix to all integer constants that are meant to be unsigned.

- **Literal Suffixes:**
  - Use uppercase letters for literal suffixes (e.g., `L` for long) to avoid confusion with similar-looking characters.

- **String Literals:**
  - Assign string literals to `const`-qualified pointers to prevent accidental modification.

### Declarations and Definitions

- **Explicit Type Specifications:**
  - Always specify types explicitly; do not rely on implicit typing.

- **Function Prototypes:**
  - Use function prototypes with named parameters to enable type checking.

- **Consistent Declarations:**
  - Ensure all declarations of an object or function use the same names and type qualifiers.

- **Visibility of Declarations:**
  - When defining an object or function with external linkage, ensure a compatible declaration is visible.

- **Single Declaration Rule:**
  - Declare external objects or functions in only one header file.

- **Unique Definitions:**
  - An identifier with external linkage should have exactly one external definition.

- **Scope of Identifiers:**
  - Limit the scope of identifiers to where they are needed.

- **Use of `static` Keyword:**
  - Use `static` for all declarations of objects and functions that have internal linkage.

### Enumerations

- **Unique Enumeration Constants:**
  - Ensure that each implicitly assigned enumeration constant has a unique value within its list.

### Pointer Usage

- **Const-Qualified Pointers:**
  - Whenever possible, pointers should point to `const`-qualified types.

- **Avoid `restrict` Keyword:**
  - Do not use the `restrict` type qualifier to prevent undefined behavior due to incorrect usage.

### Alignment Specifications (C11)

- **Consistency in Alignment:**
  - If an object has an explicit alignment, all declarations should specify the same alignment.

- **Zero Alignment:**
  - Avoid specifying an alignment of zero; it can lead to implementation-defined behavior.

- **Single Alignment Specifier:**
  - Use at most one explicit alignment specifier in an object declaration.

---

## Initialization

### Uninitialized Variables

- **Initialize Automatic Variables:**
  - Do not read the value of an automatic (local) variable before it has been initialized.

### Use of Braces in Initializers

- **Braced Initializers for Aggregates:**
  - Enclose initializers for aggregates (arrays and structs) and unions in braces.

### Full Initialization of Arrays

- **Do Not Partially Initialize Arrays:**
  - If any element of an array is initialized, all elements should be explicitly initialized.

### Unique Initialization

- **Single Initialization per Element:**
  - Do not initialize an element of an object more than once.

### Designated Initializers

- **Specify Array Size with Designated Initializers:**
  - When using designated initializers for arrays, explicitly specify the size of the array.

### Chained Designators

- **Avoid Mixing Chained and Positional Initializers:**
  - Do not use initializers without designators if you are using chained designators.

### Initialization of Atomic Objects (C11)

- **Initialize Atomic Objects Appropriately:**
  - Use `atomic_init` to initialize atomic objects before accessing them.

---

## Expressions and Side Effects

### Operator Precedence

- **Make Operator Precedence Explicit:**
  - Use parentheses to make the order of evaluation clear, especially when mixing different operators.

### Shift Operators

- **Valid Shift Amounts:**
  - Ensure that the right-hand operand of a shift operator is within the valid range (0 to width of left operand minus one).

### Avoid Comma Operator

- **Do Not Use Comma Operator:**
  - Avoid using the comma operator to combine multiple expressions into one statement.

### Avoid Unsigned Wrap-Around in Constants

- **Prevent Unsigned Integer Wrap-Around:**
  - Ensure that constant expressions do not lead to wrap-around for unsigned integers.

### Sizeof Operator Usage

- **Avoid Sizeof on Array Parameters:**
  - Do not use the `sizeof` operator on function parameters declared as arrays; they decay to pointers.

### Side Effects in Expressions

- **Avoid Side Effects in Expressions:**
  - Ensure that expressions yield the same result regardless of evaluation order, and avoid side effects that depend on evaluation order.

### Use of Increment and Decrement Operators

- **Isolate Increment/Decrement Operators:**
  - Use `++` and `--` operators in standalone statements to avoid side effects.

### Assignment Operator Usage

- **Avoid Using Assignment in Expressions:**
  - Do not use the result of an assignment as an expression.

### Logical Operators and Side Effects

- **Avoid Side Effects in Logical Expressions:**
  - The right-hand operand of `&&` or `||` should not contain side effects.

### Sizeof and Side Effects

- **No Side Effects in Sizeof Operands:**
  - The operand of the `sizeof` operator should not contain expressions with side effects.

---

## Control Flow and Loop Constructs

### Loop Counters

- **Use Integer Types for Loop Counters:**
  - Do not use floating-point variables as loop counters due to precision issues.

- **Avoid Modifying Loop Counters Within the Loop Body:**
  - Do not alter loop counters inside the loop body; it can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Well-Formed `for` Loops

- **Structure of `for` Loops:**
  - Ensure `for` loops are well-formed with proper initialization, condition, and iteration expressions.
  - Do not modify the loop counter within the loop body.

### Invariant Controlling Expressions

- **Ensure Controlling Expressions Vary:**
  - The controlling expressions of loops and conditional statements should not be invariant; they should depend on variables that can change.

### Controlling Expressions Type

- **Use Boolean Expressions:**
  - The controlling expressions of `if`, `while`, `for`, and `do...while` statements should have an essentially Boolean type.

### Use of `goto` Statement

- **Avoid `goto` Statements:**
  - Do not use `goto` statements as they can make code harder to read and maintain.

- **Exception:**
  - If necessary, `goto` should only jump forward to labels declared later in the same function.
  - The `goto` statement should only jump to labels in the same block or an enclosing block.

### Loop Exits

- **Limit Exits from Loops:**
  - There should be no more than one `break` or `goto` statement used to terminate any iteration statement.

### Single Exit Point in Functions

- **Single Return Statement:**
  - A function should have a single point of exit at the end, with no early returns.

### Compound Statements in Control Structures

- **Use Braces Consistently:**
  - The body of an `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, or `do...while` statement should be enclosed in braces, even if it contains only a single statement.

### `if...else if...else` Constructs

- **Terminate with `else`:**
  - All `if...else if` constructs should be terminated with an `else` statement, even if it's empty or contains a comment explaining why no action is needed.

---

## Functions

### Function Declarations

- **Use Function Prototypes:**
  - Declare functions explicitly with prototypes; do not rely on implicit declarations.

### Variable Arguments

- **Avoid Variable Argument Lists:**
  - Do not use functions with variable numbers of arguments (e.g., functions declared with `...`).
  - Avoid including `<stdarg.h>` and using features provided by it.

### Recursion

- **Do Not Use Recursion:**
  - Functions should not call themselves, either directly or indirectly, to prevent stack overflows.

### Return Statements

- **Return Value Usage:**
  - All exit paths from a function with a non-void return type should have an explicit `return` statement with an expression.

- **Use of Return Values:**
  - The value returned by a function having a non-void return type should be used.
  - If the return value is intentionally unused, cast it to `(void)` to indicate that.

### Function Parameters

- **Do Not Modify Function Parameters:**
  - Avoid modifying function parameters within the function body; use local variables instead.

### `_Noreturn` Functions (C11)

- **Use `_Noreturn` Specifier Appropriately:**
  - Functions that do not return to their caller should be declared with the `_Noreturn` specifier.
  - Such functions should have a `void` return type.

- **Do Not Return from `_Noreturn` Functions:**
  - A function declared with `_Noreturn` should not return to its caller under any circumstances.
  - Ensure all code paths in such functions do not reach the end of the function.

### Function Identifiers

- **Use Function Identifiers Properly:**
  - A function identifier should only be used with either a preceding `&` (address-of operator), or with a parenthesized parameter list.

### Type Qualifiers in Function Types

- **Do Not Use Type Qualifiers on Function Types:**
  - A function type should not be type-qualified with `const`, `volatile`, `restrict`, or `_Atomic`.

### Variable-Length Arrays in Function Parameters

- **Avoid Variable-Length Arrays:**
  - Do not use variable-length arrays in function parameters or elsewhere.
  - Prefer fixed-size arrays or dynamically allocated memory if necessary.

---

## Pointers and Arrays

### Pointer Arithmetic

- **Avoid Pointer Arithmetic:**
  - Do not perform arithmetic on pointers that could result in pointing outside the bounds of an array.
  - Pointer arithmetic should only be used within the same array.

### Pointer Subtraction

- **Only Subtract Pointers Pointing into Same Array:**
  - Subtraction between pointers should only be applied to pointers that address elements of the same array.

### Pointer Comparisons

- **Limit Pointer Comparisons:**
  - The relational operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` should not be applied to pointers unless they point into the same object.

### Avoid Pointer Type Conversions

- **Do Not Convert Between Function Pointers and Object Pointers:**
  - Avoid converting pointers to functions into pointers to objects, and vice versa.

### Pointer to Incomplete Types

- **Do Not Perform Operations on Pointers to Incomplete Types:**
  - Do not perform pointer arithmetic or dereference pointers to incomplete types (e.g., opaque types).

### Multiple Levels of Pointer Nesting

- **Limit Pointer Nesting:**
  - Declarations should contain no more than two levels of pointer nesting for readability and maintainability.

### Storage Duration and Pointers

- **Do Not Return Addresses of Local Variables:**
  - Do not assign or return the address of an object with automatic storage duration to an object that persists after the first object has ceased to exist.

### Flexible Array Members

- **Do Not Use Flexible Array Members:**
  - Avoid declaring flexible array members in structures, as they can lead to undefined behavior.

### Variable-Length Arrays

- **Do Not Use Variable-Length Arrays:**
  - Avoid using variable-length arrays, as their size is not known at compile-time and can lead to stack overflows.

---

## Memory Management

### Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation

- **Static Memory Allocation:**
  - Do not use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, or `free` in critical systems.
  - Allocate all required memory at compile time.

### Handle Memory Carefully

- **Prevent Memory Leaks:**
  - Ensure that all allocated resources are properly released.

- **Avoid Dangling Pointers:**
  - After freeing memory, set the pointer to `NULL`.

### Free Only Allocated Memory

- **Match Allocation and Deallocation:**
  - Only free memory that was allocated using standard memory allocation functions.
  - Do not attempt to free memory that was not dynamically allocated.

- **Do Not Double-Free Memory:**
  - Avoid freeing the same memory block more than once.

---

## Overlapping Storage

### Object Copying and Assignment

- **Do Not Assign Overlapping Objects:**
  - An object should not be assigned or copied to an overlapping object.
  - Use `memmove` if overlapping copy is necessary.

### Use of Unions

- **Avoid Using Unions:**
  - The `union` keyword should not be used, as accessing a member other than the one most recently written can lead to undefined behavior.

---

## Concurrency and Synchronization

### Prevent Data Races

- **Use Mutexes and Semaphores:**
  - Protect shared resources accessed by multiple threads.

- **Use Atomic Operations:**
  - For simple shared variables, use atomic types if available.

### Avoid Deadlocks

- **Consistent Lock Ordering:**
  - Always acquire multiple locks in a predefined global order.

- **Timeouts and Deadlock Detection:**
  - Implement timeouts or deadlock detection mechanisms where appropriate.

### Minimize Shared Resources

- **Encapsulate Shared Data:**
  - Limit the scope of shared data and expose it through controlled interfaces.

### Thread Synchronization Objects (C11)

- **Proper Use of Synchronization Functions:**
  - Access thread synchronization objects only through appropriate library functions.

- **Storage Duration of Synchronization Objects:**
  - Ensure that synchronization objects have appropriate storage duration (e.g., static or allocated).

- **Initialization Before Use:**
  - Initialize mutexes and condition variables before use.

- **Destruction After Use:**
  - Do not destroy synchronization objects until all threads accessing them have terminated.

### Mutex Management (C11)

- **Mutex Locking and Unlocking:**
  - Mutexes should be locked and unlocked by the same thread.

- **Avoid Recursive Locking:**
  - Non-recursive mutexes should not be recursively locked.

- **Proper Mutex Initialization:**
  - Initialize mutexes with the correct type (e.g., `mtx_plain`, `mtx_timed`).

### Condition Variables (C11)

- **Association with Mutexes:**
  - A condition variable should be associated with only one mutex.

### Thread Management (C11)

- **Thread Termination:**
  - Do not join or detach a thread more than once.

- **Thread-Specific Storage:**
  - Create thread-specific storage before use and ensure it is not destroyed while still in use.

## File and Header Management

### Prevent Multiple Inclusions

- **Use Include Guards:**
  - Protect header files from being included multiple times.

### File Access Modes

- **Single Access Mode per Stream:**
  - Do not open the same file for read and write access simultaneously on different streams.

### Avoid Writing to Read-Only Streams

- **Write Only to Writable Streams:**
  - Do not attempt to write to a stream that has been opened in read-only mode.

### `FILE` Pointer Usage

- **Do Not Dereference `FILE` Pointers:**
  - Avoid directly dereferencing pointers to `FILE` objects.

### Closing Streams

- **Validity of `FILE` Pointers:**
  - Do not use a `FILE` pointer after the associated stream has been closed.

### Consistent Naming

- **Clear and Unambiguous Identifiers:**
  - Avoid confusing characters in identifiers (e.g., `l`, `1`, `O`, `0`).
  - Use descriptive names that convey meaning.

- **Unique Identifiers:**
  - Ensure that identifiers are unique across the entire project to prevent linkage issues.

---

## Preprocessing Directives

### Valid Preprocessing Directives

- **Ensure Valid Preprocessing Directives:**
  - A line whose first token is `#` should be a valid preprocessing directive.
  - Avoid malformed or invalid preprocessing directives, even within excluded code blocks.

### Matching Preprocessor Directives

- **Close Preprocessor Blocks in Same File:**
  - All `#else`, `#elif`, and `#endif` directives should reside in the same file as the corresponding `#if`, `#ifdef`, or `#ifndef` directive.

### Placement of `#include` Directives

- **Place Includes at File Start:**
  - `#include` directives should only be preceded by other preprocessor directives or comments.

### Header File Names

- **Use Valid Header Names:**
  - The `'`, `"`, `\` characters, and the `/*` or `//` sequences should not occur in a header file name.

### Form of `#include` Directive

- **Use Correct `#include` Syntax:**
  - The `#include` directive should be followed by either `<filename>` or `"filename"`.

### Macro Names and Keywords

- **Avoid Macro Names Matching Keywords:**
  - Do not define macros with the same names as keywords.

### Use of `#undef`

- **Avoid Undefining Macros:**
  - The `#undef` directive should not be used, as it can make code harder to understand.

### Tokens in Macro Arguments

- **Avoid Preprocessor Directives in Macro Arguments:**
  - Tokens that look like preprocessing directives should not occur within macro arguments.

### Macro Parentheses

- **Parenthesize Macro Parameters:**
  - Expressions resulting from the expansion of macro parameters should be enclosed in parentheses.

### Preprocessor Expressions

- **Boolean Preprocessor Expressions:**
  - The controlling expression of `#if` or `#elif` directives should evaluate to 0 or 1.

- **Defined Identifiers in Preprocessor Expressions:**
  - All identifiers used in the controlling expression of `#if` or `#elif` should be defined before evaluation.

### Stringification and Concatenation Operators

- **Avoid `#` and `##` Operators:**
  - The `#` and `##` preprocessor operators should not be used, as they can lead to complex and hard-to-read code.

---

## Use of Libraries and Functions

### Validation of Inputs

- **Check Input Parameters:**
  - Validate all inputs before using them in functions.

### Error Handling

- **Test Function Return Values:**
  - Check the return values of functions that can indicate errors.
  - Handle errors immediately after function calls.

### Prefer Functions Over Macros

- **Use Inline Functions:**
  - Replace function-like macros with inline functions for type safety and debugging ease.

### Restricted Standard Headers

- **Avoid Certain Standard Headers:**
  - Do not include `<setjmp.h>`, `<signal.h>`, or use functions declared in these headers.

### Avoid Input/Output Functions

- **Limited Use of I/O Functions:**
  - Avoid using input/output functions from `<stdio.h>` and `<wchar.h>`.

### Type-Generic Macros (C99 and Later)

- **Avoid `<tgmath.h>`:**
  - Do not include `<tgmath.h>` or use type-generic macros declared in it.

- **Valid Arguments for Type-Generic Macros:**
  - Ensure that all operand arguments to type-generic macros have appropriate essential types.

### Floating-Point Environment Functions

- **Avoid `<fenv.h>`:**
  - Do not include `<fenv.h>` or use functions declared in it due to potential undefined behaviors.

### Character Classification Functions

- **Valid Arguments for `<ctype.h>` Functions:**
  - Any value passed to functions in `<ctype.h>` should be representable as an `unsigned char` or be the value `EOF`.

### Memory and String Functions

- **Use `memcmp` Appropriately:**
  - Do not use `memcmp` to compare null-terminated strings or structures due to potential undefined behavior.

- **Pointer Compatibility:**
  - Pointers passed to `memcpy`, `memmove`, and `memcmp` should point to objects of compatible types.

- **Avoid Using `memcpy` for Overlapping Objects:**
  - Use `memmove` instead when objects overlap.

- **String Functions Boundaries:**
  - Ensure that string handling functions do not access memory beyond the bounds of the objects referenced.

- **Size Arguments in String Functions:**
  - The `size_t` arguments passed to functions like `strncpy` and `strncat` should have appropriate values.

### Functions Returning Modifiable Pointers

- **Treat Returned Pointers as `const`-Qualified:**
  - Pointers returned by functions like `getenv`, `localeconv`, `setlocale`, and `strerror` should be used as if they point to `const` data.

- **Validity of Returned Pointers:**
  - Do not use pointers returned by certain standard functions after subsequent calls to the same function.

### System Functions

- **Avoid `system` Function:**
  - Do not use the `system` function from `<stdlib.h>` due to security risks.

### Random Number Generation

- **Avoid Standard Random Functions:**
  - Do not use `rand` and `srand` functions; use a secure and appropriate random number generator instead.

---

## Error Handling and `errno`

### Setting `errno` Before Function Calls

- **Initialize `errno` to Zero:**
  - Set `errno` to zero before calling functions that may set it.

### Checking `errno` After Function Calls

- **Test `errno` After Function Calls:**
  - Check the value of `errno` after calling functions that may set it.

### Using `errno` Appropriately

- **Test `errno` Only After Relevant Functions:**
  - Only test `errno` if the last function called was one that may set it.

---

## Standard Libraries and Resources

### Reserved Identifiers and Macros

- **Do Not Redefine Reserved Names:**
  - Do not use `#define` or `#undef` on reserved identifiers or macro names, including those beginning with an underscore or defined in standard headers.

- **Do Not Declare Reserved Names:**
  - Avoid declaring reserved identifiers or macro names in your code.

### Memory Allocation Functions

- **Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation Functions:**
  - Do not use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`, or related memory allocation functions from `<stdlib.h>`.
