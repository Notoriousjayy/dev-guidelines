# C Best Practices

## Security Principles
- **Input Validation:**
  - Use secure functions like `fgets()` instead of `gets()` to prevent buffer overflows.
  - Validate input length and format before processing.
  - Avoid trusting input from unverified sources.

- **Secure String Handling:**
  - Use `strncpy()` instead of `strcpy()` to avoid buffer overflows.
  - Always null-terminate strings explicitly if needed.

- **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets:**
  - Use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., environment variables) instead of embedding secrets directly in code.

---

## Memory Safety
- **Memory Allocation:**
  - Prefer `calloc()` over `malloc()` to zero-initialize memory and reduce vulnerabilities due to uninitialized memory access.
  - Free dynamically allocated memory with `free()` and ensure double-free vulnerabilities are avoided.

- **Buffer Safety:**
  - Avoid off-by-one errors by ensuring buffer bounds checks.
  - Use functions like `memcpy_s()` and `strncpy()` for safer memory copying.

- **Pointer Safety:**
  - Always initialize pointers to `NULL` and check before dereferencing.
  - Avoid pointer arithmetic unless absolutely necessary, and validate the resulting pointer.

---

## Error Handling
- **Use Return Codes:**
  - Check the return values of all standard library functions.
  - For critical functions, log and handle errors explicitly.

- **`errno` Management:**
  - Reset `errno` before operations that may fail and check its value afterwards.
  - Avoid overwriting `errno` unintentionally.

---

## Compiler Settings
- **Recommended Compiler Flags:**
  - `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` for GCC/Clang to catch common coding errors.
  - `-fsanitize=address` to detect memory corruption issues.

- **Standards Conformance:**
  - Use `-std=c99` or later to ensure modern C practices and compatibility.

---

## File I/O
- **Avoid Vulnerable Functions:**
  - Replace `sprintf()` with `snprintf()` to prevent buffer overflows.
  - Always validate file handles before performing read/write operations.

- **Safe File Access:**
  - Use `fopen_s()` instead of `fopen()` on platforms where it's available.
  - Avoid hardcoding file paths; use configurable parameters instead.

---

## Integer Safety
- **Prevent Overflow:**
  - Use `size_t` for array indices and avoid signed integer overflow.
  - Validate ranges before performing arithmetic operations.

- **Avoid Truncation:**
  - Use explicit casting to prevent truncation during type conversion.

# Best Practices for C Programming in Critical Systems

## Overview
This document outlines best practices derived from MISRA C:2023 for developing safe, secure, and portable C programs in critical systems. These guidelines ensure compliance with safety, security, and reliability requirements.

---

## General Principles

### Adherence to Standards
- Use a defined subset of the C language to reduce ambiguity and potential programming errors.
- Eliminate or mitigate undefined and implementation-specific behaviors.
- Follow mandatory, required, and advisory guidelines as outlined by MISRA C.

### Documentation and Traceability
- All implementation-defined behaviors that affect program output **must** be documented and thoroughly understood.
- Ensure every piece of code is traceable to specific, documented requirements to eliminate unnecessary or unintentional functionality.

---

## Code Design and Development

### Robustness Against Failures
- Perform **dynamic checks** to minimize run-time errors:
  - Ensure array indices are within bounds before accessing.
  - Validate all pointers before dereferencing.
  - Guard against arithmetic errors such as overflow, underflow, or divide-by-zero.
- Provide clear documentation for areas where dynamic checks are omitted, supported by static analysis or design assumptions.

### Encapsulation
- Encapsulate assembly language within macros or inline functions for portability and maintainability.
- Use opaque data types to hide implementation details and reduce unintentional modifications.

### Use of Typedefs
- Replace basic types (`int`, `float`, etc.) with specific-length typedefs (`int32_t`, `uint8_t`) to ensure predictable memory use.
- Avoid defining types that do not match their intended size or signedness.

---

## Use of Libraries and Functions

### Validation of Inputs
- Validate all inputs passed to library functions, including those in the Standard Library and custom libraries.
- Examples:
  - Check that arguments to `sqrt` are non-negative.
  - Ensure the second argument of `fmod` is non-zero.

### Error Handling
- Test all error information returned by functions immediately after execution.
- If error testing is not required due to pre-validation, document this explicitly.

### Avoid Function-Like Macros
- Prefer inline functions over function-like macros to ensure argument type-checking and prevent multiple evaluations of macro arguments.

---

## Memory Management

### Avoid Dynamic Allocation
- Avoid using dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) in critical systems to prevent undefined behaviors such as memory leaks or invalid access.

---

## File and Header Management

### Prevent Multiple Inclusions
- Use include guards to prevent the same header file from being included multiple times:
  ```c
  #ifndef HEADER_NAME
  #define HEADER_NAME
  // Header content
  #endif
  ```

### Consistent Naming
- Use meaningful, typographically unambiguous names for identifiers:
  - Avoid `O` vs. `0`, `l` vs. `1`, `I` vs. `l`.
  - Prefer descriptive names with underscores or camelCase for clarity.

---

## Concurrency and Synchronization

### Concurrency Awareness
- Design for thread safety when using C11/C18 threading features.
- Avoid race conditions by using synchronization primitives such as mutexes or atomics.

### Minimize Shared Resources
- Encapsulate shared resources and use controlled access patterns to ensure consistency.

---

## Static Analysis and Tools

### Leverage Analysis Tools
- Use static analysis tools capable of checking MISRA C compliance. Ensure these tools are correctly configured for the project.
- Address all reported violations, especially for mandatory and required rules.

### Scope of Analysis
- Analyze both system-level and translation-unit-level code for full coverage of rules and guidelines.

---

## Example Implementations

### Avoiding Undefined Behavior
**Non-compliant Example:**
```c
int x = 0;
if (x = 1) { // Mistake: assignment instead of comparison
    // Code
}
```

**Compliant Example:**
```c
int x = 0;
if (x == 1) { // Correct: comparison operator
    // Code
}
```

### Validating Inputs
**Non-compliant Example:**
```c
double result = sqrt(-1); // Invalid input for sqrt
```

**Compliant Example:**
```c
if (value >= 0) {
    double result = sqrt(value);
} else {
    // Handle error
}
```

---

## Exceptions and Deviations

### Formal Documentation of Deviations
- If deviations from mandatory or required guidelines are necessary, document them formally as per MISRA Compliance processes.
- Justify deviations with clear reasoning, impact analysis, and any mitigating strategies.

---

## Advanced Topics

### Automatically Generated Code
- Ensure code generated by tools adheres to MISRA C where applicable.
- Validate the configuration and behavior of code-generation tools to ensure compliance.

### Multi-Organization Collaboration
- For shared projects, define a unified compliance strategy and agree on coding standards upfront.
- When sharing precompiled libraries, provide documentation or compliance declarations.
